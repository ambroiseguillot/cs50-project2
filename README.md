# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, Project 2, FLACK

---

## Objectives
Build an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. 
Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. 
Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. 
Finally, youâ€™ll add a personal touch to your chat application of your choosing!

-create_room.html: separate page with a form to create a new chatroom
-about.html : what the project is about
